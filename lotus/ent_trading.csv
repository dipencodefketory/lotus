System is a fully integrated hands on stick and throttle flight controller that meets or exceeds the demands of the best flight simulator pilots. Featuring an upgraded multifunction LCD which shows in-game data in real time, a progressive throttle with tension adjustment, plus an adjustable joystick with a self-centering mechanism. The X52 Pro takes all the standout features from the original X52 and elevates them to a higher altitude.</p><h4>Dual-Spring Centering Mechanism</h4><p>	A highly accurate centering mechanism ensures the joystick will easily return to the neutral position after you let go. Non-contact technology on the X and Y axes enhance control while increasing durability. And, the stick becomes more resistant as it moves farther away from the center position.</p><h4>Advanced Grip Adjustment System</h4><p>A five-position handle adjustment system conforms to your grip style and hand size. And to promote maximum comfort during long flights, the joystick's handle also features contours which harmonize with your digits.</p><h4>3D Twist with Rudder Lock</h4><p>The joystick's twist rudder controls add another dimension of command to simulated flight. If you prefer more traditional control, a rudder lock switch disables the twist capabilities and confines input to the X and Y axes â ideal for use with Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals (sold separately).</p><h4>Progressive Throttle with Resistance Adjustment</h4><p>The throttle unit's progressive functionality improves aircraft response. Detents â physical markings indicating where a certain action takes places â simplify control of your plane's idle and reverse thrusters. Yet another customizable feature found on the X52 Pro, a tension adjustment dial lets you change the throttle's resistance to suit the way you fly.</p><h4>Multifunction LCD Display</h4><p>The X-52 Pro's LCD screen â with adjustable backlighting â enables you to view information about your button configurations with only a quick glance. Even more beneficial is the ability to directly manipulate radio stack information in FSX, X-Plane, Prepar3D, and most flight simulation software. You can then use the buttons residing below the Multifunction Display (MFD) to cycle through essential radio stack functions. A downloadable Software Development Kit allows you to create your own MFD interactions.</p><h5>Product Includes:</h5><ul><li>X52 Pro Stick Unit with USB Connector Cable</li><li>X52 Pro Throttle Unit with USB Connector Cable</li></ul><h5>Flight Simulation Software Compatibility:</h5><ul><li>FSX - Flight Simulator X (PC only)</li><li>X-Plane 10(PC and Mac)</li><li>Prepar3DÂ® 2.2(PC only)</li><li>Most Other Flight Simulation Software</li></ul><h5>Minimum System Requirements:</h5><ul><li>WindowsÂ®: 7, 8.1, 10</li><li>1x USB 2.0 Port</li></ul><h5>Combatible with Most Flight Simulation, Combat Simulation, and Space Simulation Software including:</h5><ul><li>Flight Simulator X</li><li>Flight Simulator 2004</li><li>X-Plane 10</li><li>X-Plane 9</li><li>Star Citizen</li><li>Elite Dangerous</li><li>DCS World</li><li>DCS: A-10C Warthog</li><li>DCS: Black Shark 2</li><li>DCS: UH-1H Huey</li><li>Lock On: Modern Air Combat (LOMAC)</li><li>Lock On: Flaming Cliffs 3</li><li>Lock On: Flaming Cliffs 2</li><li>Lock On: Flaming Cliffs</li><li>aerofly FS</li><li>Take On Helicopters (TKOH)</li><li>Rise of Flight</li><li>Arma 3</li><li>Falcon 4.0: Allied Force</li><li>Falcon BMS 4.32</li><li>World of Warplanes</li><li>War Thunder</li></ul>

It not only connects to a TV at home, but it also instantly transforms into an on-the-go handheld using its 6.2-inch screen. For the first time, players can enjoy a full home-console experience anytime, anywhere. The screen includes capacitive multi-touch capabilities for compatible games. Battery life can last for more than six hours, but will vary depending on the software and usage conditions.. For example, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild can be played for roughly three hours on a single charge. While away from home, Nintendo Switch can be charged by plugging the AC adapter into the console's USB Type-C connector.<br></p>

High-speed races on powerful bikes alternate with motocross on more nimble machines for a white-knuckle ride that remains playable despite the need for technical prowess, with rules of fair-play often put to one side. Moto Racer 4, which is still developed by MicroÃ¯ds and Artefacts Studio, under the supervision of its original designer, Paul Cuisset, will include no less than 15 single and multiplayer game modes. In addition to regular fixtures such as the Time Trial, Single Race and Championship, here are a few examples of what to expect:</p><ul><li>KING OF THE HILL: Each rider starts with the same time on the clock. While time runs down for the leader, the other racers get extra turbo. The first player to get their counter down to zero wins the race.</li><li>LAST MAN STANDING: The last player to pass each checkpoint is eliminated.</li><li>SURVIVAL: The race starts with very little time on the clock. Players gain time by passing the checkpoints. In single-player mode, the aim is to survive for a specific length of time. In multi-player mode, the winner is the last player with time left on their clock.</li><li>CATCH-UP: The player's opponents begin the race with a headstart and the player must be in first place at a specific time.</li><li>WOLF PACK: The player begins the race with a headstart and must maintain it for a certain length of time without being overtaken.</li><li>GHOST BIKE: The player starts the race in last place and is not allowed to deviate from the road or collide with others. S/he must finish in a specified minimum place.</li><li>GOLDEN HELMET: Competitors must earn the one golden helmet up for grabs during therace. To do this, they must be first past the initial checkpoint. If the player wearing the golden helmet is knocked by another player, s/he surrenders it to that player. If a player falls off their bike, s/he loses the helmet and it is automatically sent to the next checkpoint.</li></ul><p>Here is a reminder of the main features of Moto Racer 4 that have already been revealed:</p><ul><li>Alternating high-speed/motocross races</li><li>Traffic on the road</li><li>Split-screen multi-player mode</li><li>Online multi-player mode (2-10 players)</li><li>60 images per second</li><li>Vehicle and rider customization</li><li>Possibility of colliding with opponents</li><li>Each competitor has a different personality and behavioural traits</li></ul>

Run the sheriffâs department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions â and try to keep out of prison yourself! â in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence.&nbsp</p><p>Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. Itâs a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). Sheâs struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who arenât used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.<br><strong><br>Features:</strong><br></p><p>Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience â this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? Itâs all of these, and more!&nbsp<br>Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on âforest spiritsâ and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who wonât go along willingly â you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way.<br>Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates arenât just some resource they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices â and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everythingâs built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.</p>

The remote-controlled car is equipped with a camera, so you can keep a sharp eye while maneuvering around with your Nintendo Switch.

Because, letâs face it, youâll do anything to win.</strong></p><p><strong>LOCAL AND ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, BUT SUPER WEIRD</strong></p><p>Challenge your friends to insane brawls, where the goal is to pluck heads from shoulders and use them to get that much-desired victory! Headsnatchers has 25 ridiculous maps with unique, yet unlikely, weapons and features, with their own steps and rules to follow. Well, theyâre more like guidelines. Nobody likes rules. Dunk your buddiesâ heads through hoops like LeBron, kick your grandpaâs gobbler through a portal to hell like Doomguy&trade and flush your sisterâs brain-basket down the toilet like the dooky you pushed out 5 hours after you shoved that XL pizza down your face. You name it, Headsnatchers has got it. Probably.</p><p><strong>OFF WITH THEIR (100+) HEADS</strong></p><p>Because apparently kids nowadays are all about self-expression and unique identifiers, we felt we couldnât stay behind the times. With over 100 unique heads to choose from, thereâs a head for everyone. Did we mention there are pop culture references? Thereâs a head that resembles that one angry guy from that anime you used to love, and one from a children's show with a certain mathematically challenged Count. If you donât like any of those, make your own heads using the Headitor! You can save up to 20 heads, so go nuts trying to recreate those school dweebs who used to pick you last for gym.</p><p><strong>A SINGLE PLAYER MODE MADE JUST FOR YOU</strong></p><p>Sometimes you just need a little me-time - we totally get it. Rip it up in the single-player Zombie Castle-mode! This single-player feature spans across three different difficulty levels. âBut, my dudes, every game has multiple difficulties nowadaysâ, we hear you thinking. Zombie Castle is different throughout its easy, normal and hard modes. Different levels, different everything, same zombies. Weâre calling it right now: you canât beat them all. Probably.</p><p><strong>OBLIGATORY KEY FEATURE BULLET POINTS</strong></p><p>Weâre sorry, but we just have to go over all of the features one last time. Okay, ready?</p><ul><li>Local and online* multiplayer, support up to 4 players</li><li>4 game modes and 25 unique levels</li><li>Zombie Castle single-player mode, for when you really need some me-time</li><li>Choose from 100 heads</li><li>A limitless custom head creator* (yes, weâre calling it the Headitor, and thereâs nothing you can do about it) that allows you to save up to 20 custom heads*</li></ul>

Insane enemy patterns and swarms, giant god-like guardians, ancient temples, contraptions and treasures, visual ecstasy... All in a vast and unexplored universe only ruled by physic laws. What if the coin-op machines golden age started today, adding complex maneuverability abilities, encouraging spatial awareness, as well as an A.I. adapting to the way you play? Here is the chance to know.</p><p>	<strong>The Worlds</strong></p><p>	Kromaia takes place in a multiverse and tells the story of a stranded soul who awakens in a weird shrine, finding itself sealed inside a mechanical unit. Having no memories at all, it must make its way in search for answers, in a world of forgotten devices and hostile creatures, while a somehow familiar voice within claims to know its mind better than itself.</p><p>	<strong>The Challenge</strong></p><p>	Is it still possible to make something different set in outer space? We do think so. For that reason, you will not find in Kromaia slow movement, ships maneuvering like planes or boats, nor endless steering pursuits in circles, but a completely different approach. Our navigation system is entirely driven by physical forces, a different set of thrusters is arranged for each ship in order to maximize maneuverability: Fluid displacement for novices and, for experts, impossible turns and extreme dodging, combined with a powerful multidirectional boost system that allows moving over the real speed of sound in any way you can imagine.</p><p>	Forget all the vehicles you have already controlled like aircrafts, rockets, choppers or traditional spaceships, think of all of their capabilities available at the same time at the tip of your fingers. Besides, Kromaia features a special kind of emergent gameplay: Here we will use the word procedural for something different than just randomly generated worlds. The advanced A.I. system in Kromaia uses physical parameters and a sophisticated prediction model to adapt units speed, attacks, flocking and smart group formations to the actions you take during your quest. The results: the game experience is different every time depending on the way you play.</p><p>	<strong>Highlights</strong></p><li>Experience one of the fastest and most agile gameplays to date</li><li>Interact with hundreds of physical objects, like asteroids, structures and devices, and fight dozens of enemies at once</li><li>Believable and destructible world with its own rules and physic laws</li><li>Unique graphical appearance, gameplay and immersive experience</li><li>Artificial intelligence based on independent simple brains that cooperate creating emergent behaviours</li><li>Different selectable ships with unique weapons and capabilities</li><li>Moddable content using plain text (XML) including levels, objects, weapons, player and AI units...</li><li>Several playing modes for every kind of player: Score Attack (arcade), Story Mode (adventure), Timed Circuit (racing)...</li>
